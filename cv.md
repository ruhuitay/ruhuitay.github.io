# About Me
I started my programming journey during the Undergraduate Research Opportunity at Imperial College London. 
For the first time, I started writing code that made my data analysis work so much more fun and efficient, and thus, never stopped since then.
To improve my programming skills, I decided to focus on working on a Computational Chemistry project for my Bachelor's Thesis.
Later, combining my passion in biology and programming, I decided to enrol myself for the Integrated Life Science program at FAU.
There, I met a bunch of talented students and even managed to work together with a group of Data Scientists at the Max-Planck Institute for the Science of Light.
I work as a Data Analyst now in the semiconductor industry in the quality assurance department. Check out my CV below to see what I've worked on so far!


<strong> My technology stack:<strong> <br>
(Data Science/Analysis) SQL, OpenCV, scikit-learn, Pydantic, matplotlib, Json <br>
(Software Engineering) Flask, Bootstrap,  Javascript, typescript, React Qt, unit-testing, argparse, setuptools <br>
