I created this blog because I want to share the projects I have worked on so far, and what I've been up to lately, both professionally and in my private life.


I now work as a Data Analyst [here](http://sicrystal.de/index.php/en/).


In my free time, I enjoy making foods from around the world in my kitchen. To me food connects people, and exploring the different flavours from around the world is an adventure.




<!--- (This post should display a large hero image at the top of a page.

This post tests a horizontal image using the following YAML Front Matter:

```yaml
image:
  path: /images/eder-oliveira-180877.jpg
```

Hero images can also be assigned more succinctly when `thumbnail` or `caption` are not used.

```yaml
image: /images/eder-oliveira-180877.jpg
```

Tall images will push content down the page. `1600 x 600` is a good middle-ground size to aim for.--->
