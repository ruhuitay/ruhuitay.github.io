If you haven't already had the experience of apartment hunting in Germany, let me tell you, it's challenging.
Perhaps as challenging as getting a new job. Regardless of city. Why? There are simply not enough apartments or houses for the number of people.
So, start early!

I am moving cities because of a job change, in Munich. Together with my partner, Lubo, we are on the search of a 1.5 to 2 room flat in Germany - a living room and a bedroom.
In total, within Germany, we have searched for three apartments together in a span of four years. 
As for Lubo, he probably has had about six apartments in the last ten years. Hence, leveraging his experience plus
the moving action from now, I think we can be considered very qualified to give quality tips on apartment search in Germany.

To prove my point, let me quote some numbers from the apartment search portal (Immoscout24).
 Apartment 1:
A 2 room flat in Munich, Pasing. 839 applicants. Built 1974, last renovated 2002.

Apartment 2:
2 room flat, Garching. Built 1967, last renovated 2005. 432 applicants.

Apartment 3:
2 room flat Munich, Poing. A little further out from the city centre. Reachable by S-Bahn. Built 1996, last renovated 2024.
71 applicants

You get the idea. How should one compete with hundreds of applicants for one apartment?
The odds were clearly against us.


- What it means: Cold rent, Warm rent and Nebenkosten.
Cold rent:  what your landlord receives as income.

Nebenkosten: All the costs associated with living in the apartment. This includes heating costs, Hausmeister service, Winterdienst, the cleaning lady 
that ensures the cleanliness of the building.

Warm rent = Nebenkosten + Cold rent


Every year, your landlord will do a Nebenkostenabrechnung. Depending on your usage, you can get some of your money back from your Nebenkosten. 
If your heating usage has however been heavy, it could end up as a sudden large bill at the end of the payment year (an additional 500 Euros is not impossible). 
This can be the case if you try to keep yourself warm in poorly insulated or very old buildings.
Another situation where this can arise is when landlords state a very low Nebenkosten value in their listing.

Usually, landlords estimate the Nebenkosten based on the costs of the previous tenant.
In our case, 180 to 200 Euros is what we expect for a two room apartment. The larger the apartment the higher this value can be due to more heating costs.
It is also important to note that the Rundfunkbeitrag, Internet and Electricity costs are not usually included in the Nebenkosten.


- Things to look out for in a good apartment.

1. Build year - from experience, anything after 1990s is acceptable. Ideally above 1995.
   What about old build year but newly renovated? Risks associated.
2. Check the walls for mould.
3. Try to avoid attics (too warm) or basements (too cold).
4. Energy efficient certificate - from experience, anything better than C is alright.
5. Consider not only the distance to the workplace, but how well-connected the place is, how frequent the trains and buses come.
6. Any supermarkets and drogeriem√§rkte nearby? 500-600m away is usually considered convenient.
7. Consider other nice to have services nearby  - dentist, general practice clinic, bakery, hospitals
8. South facing balcony

- Other considerations that vary from flat to flat depending on owner.
1. Furnished?
2. Comes with kitchen/washing machine/dishwasher?
3. Is electricity, Rundfunkbeitrag and internet included
4. Kitchen not in living room?

- There is electricity even though I did not contact any electricity provider, why do I still need to look for one?
- What I would recommend as your electricity provider.


- What you need for a successful apartment search
It is June 2024 now. My preferred mode of search would be via ImmoScout24. 
I tried other platforms like Immowelt, but it seems to be flooded with fake apartment listings or Tauschwohnungen.
These are completely unintersting for my case
